# RoSeal i18n

RoSeal internationalization (i18n) GitHub repository that holds all of RoSeal's localization.
Changes here will not be made to RoSeal until its next update.

**Do not translate:**

- Strings marked as "DEPRECATED"
- Strings inside arrows `<>` or curly brackets "{}", these are formatted by the extension and must
  be consistent across all locales.
  - e.g: `<bold>Seal</bold>` should be translated to `<bold>Sello</bold>`, `{sealEmoji} Seal` should
    be translated to `{sealEmoji} Sello`. (example translations, may not be accurate). We will
    automatically validate these in the future.

[Discord server](https://discord.gg/YemzCFaQPC).
